## Introduction

Miracle UI is a collection of components created for React with native CSS, meaning they don't rely on third-party libraries. This makes the components much lighter and faster.

This project is created by a single person with learning objectives in mind. Anyone interested in using it is free to do so. The code is open source and available on GitHub.

Use Miracle UI components to create web applications and have fun!
